1. Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100,
$150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB'
and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named
'getBalance'. Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

2. We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each
out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B.
Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is
inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same
name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A
takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four
subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object foreach of the two
classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.

3. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that
contains empty method named printArea(). Provide three classes named
Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends
the class Shape. Each one of the classes contain only the method
printArea( ) that prints the area of the given shape.

4. Write an abstract class named Employee that contains
a. Abstract method for attendance
b. Final method to remove employee
c. Non abstract method for calculating salary as basic pay â€“ pf
Write 2 classes, Marketing and NewJoinee.
In Marketing class, implement attendance() and salary(). Add
Incentives in salary along with salary() in abstract class.
In NewJoinee class, implement only attendance()
